This module adds a client-side setting that disables mouse wheel controls for sliders & numerical input fields in Foundry VTT. This helps when you tend to accidentally change the sliders or input values in the various settings, and especially when you try to scroll through long playlists but change the volume of the tracks instead.

**Note:** It’s not enough to activate this module. You also have to enable the settings in the Module Settings in order for them to take effect. This is because as a client-side setting (that is each player can set it up to personal preference) I thought it would be best to default to the default Foundry behavior.
